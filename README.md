This ATM machine program allows users to check, deposit, withdraw, and transfer their balance. To transfer money from a user's checking account to his savings account, he must enter his savings account number: 021000021 and routing number: 084009519. This program also allows the user to confirm that the transfer amount is accurate; if not, the user is prompted to enter a new amount. Finally, the program asks the user if he wishes to conduct more transactions. If the user does not want to perform additional transactions, the program thanks the user and ends the program. 

This program has been programmed to accommodate non-integer inputs where necessary. Thus, any non-integer input will not cause the program to crash; after any non-integer input  in place of an expected integer input, the program alerts the user that the input is invalid and provides an opportunity to enter an integer.

Regarding the user's response in confirming whether the transfer amount or deposit amount is correct or whether the user wants to perform another transaction, the user may respond in any case; this will not cause any problems for the program since all user responses are converted to uppercase to eliminate case sensitivity issues.

When transferring funds from the user's checking account to his savings account, please input the savings account and routing number: 021000021, 084009519.
